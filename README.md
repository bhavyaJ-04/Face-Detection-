# Face Detection System for Secure E-Voting
This project integrates face detection into an E-Voting System to enhance security and prevent fraudulent access. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to verify voter identity before granting access to the voting portal.


##  Project Overview
Traditional e-voting systems rely on passwords or biometric authentication, which can be susceptible to spoofing or unauthorized access. This project enhances security by implementing a face detection module that verifies voters using facial recognition before allowing them to cast their votes.

## ⚙️ How It Works
--- The voter initiates the e-voting login process.
--- The system captures the voter's face in real-time using the webcam.
--- The captured face is matched against the registered database.
--- If verified, the voter is granted access to the secure blockchain-based voting system.
--- The system ensures liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.
